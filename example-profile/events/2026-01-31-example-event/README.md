## Summary

This is a demonstration event showing how to document a statement or claim in an investigative timeline. The subject made claims during a podcast interview that contradict previous documented statements, representing version 2 of this particular narrative.

---

## Context

This example event demonstrates the proper format for documenting events in a ContinuityChronicles investigative timeline. In a real profile, this section would provide background on:

- Who the subject is and why they're being documented
- The circumstances leading to this particular statement
- Why this event matters in the broader timeline

**For demonstration purposes:** Imagine the subject is a public figure who has told multiple versions of a key life event. This entry documents one version of that story as told during a podcast appearance.

## Claims vs. Records

### Claim (This Event)

- **What was claimed:** Graduated from the program in **2015**, founded company in 2016
- **Attributed to:** Example Podcast, Episode 142
- **Date of claim:** 2026-01-31
- **Quote:** "After I finished [the program] in 2015, I immediately started working on the project..."

### Contradicting Evidence

- **What records show:** In a June 2025 interview, the subject claimed graduation in **2012**
- **Source:** [2025-06-15-previous-statement](../2025-06-15-previous-statement/)
- **Date of record:** 2025-06-15
- **Why it contradicts:** The graduation year differs by 3 years between accounts. Both cannot be true.

### Additional Contradiction

- **What records show:** Social media bio from November 2024 listed graduation as **2010**
- **Source:** [2024-11-20-social-media-claim](../2024-11-20-social-media-claim/)
- **Date of record:** 2024-11-20
- **Why it contradicts:** A third graduation year introduces a pattern of inconsistency

### Version History

| Version | Date | Claimed Graduation Year | Source |
|---------|------|-------------------------|--------|
| 1 | 2024-11-20 | 2010 | Social media bio |

## Open Questions

- [ ] Has the subject addressed these discrepancies when confronted?
- [ ] Are there any official academic records that could verify the actual graduation date?
- [ ] Have other interviewers noticed or commented on these inconsistencies?
- [ ] Is there a pattern of similar inconsistencies in other biographical claims?

## Analyst Notes

This event is significant because:

1. **Pattern Recognition:** Three different graduation years across three sources suggests this is not a simple memory error but potentially a pattern of fabrication.

2. **Self-Contradiction:** The subject's explicit claim of "consistency" at 17:20 is directly contradicted by documented evidence. This demonstrates either poor memory of their own statements or deliberate misrepresentation.

3. **Escalating Timeline:** Interestingly, the claimed graduation year has moved *forward* over time (2010 → 2012 → 2015), which is unusual. Typically, embellishments involve making oneself seem more accomplished earlier, not later.

*Note: These observations are analytical interpretations, not established facts. The documented contradictions are factual; the interpretation of intent is speculative.*
