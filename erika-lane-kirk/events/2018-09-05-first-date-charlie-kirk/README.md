## Claims vs. Records

### Date Discrepancy

There is a minor discrepancy in some sources regarding when the couple began dating:

| Source | Claimed Year | Notes |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| Erika Kirk's Instagram (Sept 5, 2023) | **2018** | "5 years ago today" = September 5, 2018 |
| Yahoo/Evolve Editors article | 2019 | Incorrect; contradicted by primary source |
| ABC News | 2018 | Correctly cites Erika's Instagram |

### Resolution

Erika Kirk's own Instagram post is the primary source and definitively establishes the first date as **September 5, 2018**, not 2019. The Yahoo article's claim of 2019 appears to be an error.
